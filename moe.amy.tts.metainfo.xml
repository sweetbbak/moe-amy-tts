    <p>
      Amy text-to-speech engine that can be used as a Speech-Dispatcher module, as a command line tool to turn text into speech, or as a simple GUI interface to write and listen to text. It&apos;s great for using with bash scripts, or turning text into an audiobook. It runs great on a rapberry Pi, Steamdeck and nearly any platform. Amy TTS is a faster than real time Text-to-speech model that runs on any and all platforms thanks to Piper text-to-speech.
